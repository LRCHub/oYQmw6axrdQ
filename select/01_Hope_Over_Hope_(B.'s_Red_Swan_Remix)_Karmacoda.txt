Veering out beneath your doubt, hopes kneeling under
To the bend and in again, more light less thunder
Ohhhh

You can't move without it
You cannot feel without
Time's unjust without it,
You just can't deal...

Hope over hope under hope about hope
Hope over hope under hope about hope
Ohhhh

Don't forget the world yet, validate your meaning
Travel through find those like you, living in the feeling
Ahhhh

You can't trust without it
Round it out without
You can't wake up without it
You are not real...

Hope's over hope's under hope's about hope
Hope's over hope's under hope's about hope
Hope over hope under hope about hope
Hope over hope under hope...

You can't feel love without it (you can't feel)
Round it out (wake up without)
Without oooooohhhh...

Hope over hope over... hope...
